Future PCB Improvements:
  - Add more current limiting resistors
  - double check BUCK IC setup, put current resistor from valid output to softstart
  - FIx barrel jack footprint
  - Add power switch tot he barrel jack itself
  - Buck convert from 12-5.3v for headroom
  - Add voltage buffers to isolate the current when going into the H bridge IC
  - Add more debugging holes and ground terminals for easier debugging
